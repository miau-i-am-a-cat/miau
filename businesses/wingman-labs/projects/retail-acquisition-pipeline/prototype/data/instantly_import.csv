info@quickstopconven.com,Owner,of Quick Stop Convenience,Quick Stop Convenience,(213) 555-0101,https://quickstopla.com,Los Angeles stores are asking about this,"Hi Owner,

I run partnerships at Wingman Labs. We make energy strips — think breath strips, but with 100mg caffeine, B-vitamins, and adaptogens that actually absorb properly.

Given energy drinks are your #1 packaged beverage category, thought this might be a good fit for Quick Stop Convenience. It's a grab-and-go format that sits right at checkout that customers grab on impulse.

A few convenience stores across LA have started carrying us. Happy to send samples or hop on a 10-minute call if you're curious.

Following up on my note about energy strips for Quick Stop Convenience.

Quick stat: energy drinks are the #1 packaged beverage in convenience retail. Our strips are a premium alternative that sits at checkout — small footprint, high impulse buy rate.

Worth 10 minutes to see if it makes sense?

— Alex","Hi Owner,

Last try — I'll keep it brief.

Wingman Labs makes energy strips that a handful of convenience stores across LA are now carrying. We're based in LA, so can personally drop off samples if helpful.

Either way, no hard feelings. Just thought it'd be a fit.
