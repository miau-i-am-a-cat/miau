# The Wingman Project — Business Plan

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Domain:** thewingmanproject.com (pending)

## Executive Summary

The Wingman Project is a venture capital approach to influencer e-commerce. We identify high-growth influencers, build them professional branded e-commerce businesses in days (not months), and take equity instead of fees. 

**Thesis:** The hardest part of e-commerce is marketing. Influencers have already solved distribution — they just don't know how to monetize it properly. We bridge that gap.

**Model:** Zero retainers. Zero commissions. Zero fees. We make money by betting on you.

## The Problem

### For Influencers:
- **Monetization is broken** — Ad revenue is unpredictable, brand deals are inconsistent, affiliate margins are thin
- **Building a brand is hard** — Requires skills they don't have: product sourcing, web development, design, logistics, legal
- **Time trade-off** — Every hour spent on business is an hour not creating content (their actual value driver)
- **High failure rate** — Most influencer product launches fail due to poor execution, not poor audience fit

### For Traditional E-commerce:
- **Customer acquisition is expensive** — $30-100+ CAC in competitive niches
- **Advertising is a black hole** — Requires constant optimization, creative testing, budget
- **Influencer partnerships are painful** — High fees, low commitment, misaligned incentives

## The Solution

### Venture Model for Influencer Brands

We flip the traditional model:

| Traditional | The Wingman Project |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Influencer pays agency | We invest in influencer |
| Fees regardless of success | Equity aligned with success |
| Influencer manages business | We manage everything |
| Months to launch | Days to launch |
| High investment required | Zero upfront cost |

### How It Works

```
1. SCOUT    → Find high-engagement, high-growth influencers
2. BUILD    → Create professional brand + e-commerce site in 48-72 hours
3. PITCH    → "We built you a brand. Want it?"
4. ONBOARD  → Refine based on their feedback
5. LAUNCH   → Handle all logistics, they just promote
6. SCALE    → Reinvest profits, expand product lines
```

## Target Influencer Profile

### Quantitative Criteria:
- **Followers:** 50K - 500K (sweet spot: big enough to matter, small enough to be hungry)
- **Engagement Rate:** >3% (proves authentic connection)
- **Growth Trajectory:** >10% monthly follower growth
- **Platform:** TikTok, Instagram, YouTube (in priority order)
- **Content Frequency:** >3 posts/week (proves commitment)

### Qualitative Criteria:
- **Niche clarity** — Clear audience identity (fitness, beauty, gaming, lifestyle, etc.)
- **Authentic voice** — Not just reposting, actually creating
- **Monetization gaps** — Not already locked into exclusive brand deals
- **Personality fit** — Would authentically promote their own brand

### Red Flags:
- Bought followers (check engagement ratio)
- Controversial content that limits product options
- Already has multiple failed product launches
- Inconsistent posting schedule

| Beauty | Skincare, cosmetics, tools | 50-70% |
| Gaming | Peripherals, chairs, merch | 30-50% |
| Lifestyle | Home goods, accessories, apparel | 40-60% |
| Food/Cooking | Kitchenware, specialty foods | 35-55% |

## The Pitch

### Cold Outreach Template:

**Subject:** We built [NAME] a brand. It's yours if you want it.

**Body:**
```
Hey [NAME],

We're fans of your content — especially [SPECIFIC REFERENCE].

We think you deserve your own brand. So we built you one:
[LINK TO PREVIEW SITE]

This isn't a sponsorship or a collab. This is YOUR brand:
- Your name
- Your aesthetic  
- Products your audience actually wants

We handle everything — website, products, shipping, customer service.
You just keep doing what you're already doing.

No fees. No retainers. No catch.
We make money when you make money.

Interested? Let's talk.

### Why This Works:
1. **Pattern interrupt** — They get pitched constantly, but nobody BUILDS them something first
2. **Proof of concept** — Seeing is believing; a live preview site is worth 1000 decks
3. **Zero ask** — No commitment required to look
4. **Ego appeal** — "Your own brand" hits different than "promote our product"
5. **Risk removal** — Zero cost makes saying yes easy
