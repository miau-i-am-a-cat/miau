# The Wingman Project — Business Plan

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Domain:** thewingmanproject.com (pending)

## Executive Summary

The Wingman Project is a venture capital approach to influencer e-commerce. We identify high-growth influencers, build them professional branded e-commerce businesses in days (not months), and take equity instead of fees. 

**Thesis:** The hardest part of e-commerce is marketing. Influencers have already solved distribution — they just don't know how to monetize it properly. We bridge that gap.

**Model:** Zero retainers. Zero commissions. Zero fees. We make money by betting on you.

**Key Insight (v2.0):** Focus on high-margin, recurring-revenue product categories (skincare 65-80%, supplements 60-75%) matched to influencer niches with proven brand-building potential (beauty, wellness, fitness).

## The Problem: The Influencer's Conundrum

### The Paradox of Success

Influencers have done everything right. Years of showing up, creating content, building audiences that trust them. They've mastered the algorithm, the hooks, the posting cadence. They've built something genuinely valuable — an audience that listens.

**And yet the money doesn't match the work.**

- Brand deals are unpredictable and increasingly competitive
- Even creators with millions of followers struggle with consistent monetization
- The market is saturated — everyone with 10K followers is now an "influencer"
- Attention is cheap; rates keep dropping

### The Obvious Solution (That's Actually a Trap)

Every creator knows what would change everything: **their own brand.**

Not promoting someone else's products. Theirs. Something that earns while they sleep. Something that compounds. Something that transforms rented attention into owned equity.

The status shift alone is massive. You're not a spokesperson anymore — you're a founder. Brands don't sponsor you; they compete with you.

**But here's the trap:** The moment you start building that brand, you stop doing what made you successful.

- Every hour researching manufacturers = an hour not creating content
- Every day negotiating with suppliers = a day your engagement slips  
- Every week wrestling with Shopify = a week your audience wonders where you went
- Every month distracted by business operations = a month you fall out of creative flow

### The Market Gap

Both traditional options fail because they don't respect the fundamental truth:

**Creators create. They shouldn't have to become supply chain managers, web developers, and product designers.**

They need a partner who can build the entire business — fast — so they can stay focused on the one thing that drives value: their content and their connection with their audience.

## The Solution

### Venture Model for Influencer Brands

We flip the traditional model:

| Traditional | The Wingman Project |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Influencer pays agency | We invest in influencer |
| Fees regardless of success | Equity aligned with success |
| Influencer manages business | We manage everything |
| Months to launch | Days to launch |
| High investment required | Zero upfront cost |

### How It Works

```
1. SCOUT    → Find high-engagement, high-growth influencers in target niches
2. BUILD    → Create professional brand + e-commerce site in 48-72 hours
3. PITCH    → "We built you a brand. Want it?"
4. ONBOARD  → Refine based on their feedback
5. LAUNCH   → Handle all logistics, they just promote
6. SCALE    → Reinvest profits, expand product lines, add subscriptions
```
