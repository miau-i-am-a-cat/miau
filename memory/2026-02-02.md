## New Skill: Brand Identity Development

Krazi provided a critical new skill for Wingman Project work. Saved to `/Users/scoop/clawd/skills/brand-identity/SKILL.md`

### Key Concepts Learned:

**Reference Chaining** — The core principle. Every generated asset becomes a reference for subsequent generations:
1. Product design (foundation) → no reference needed
2. Packaging → attach product reference
3. Lifestyle shots → attach product + packaging
4. Campaign imagery → attach all relevant prior assets

**Nothing generated in isolation after first asset.**

**Model:** Google Nano Banana Pro exclusively (via fal.ai)

**Prompt Requirements:**
- Always attach references (after first asset)
- Camera/lens specs
- Lighting direction/quality/temperature
- Composition details
- Surface/environment
- Styling/props
- Color grading mood
- Aspect ratio

**8 Phases:**
1. Strategic Foundation (no images yet)
2. Visual Direction (colors, typography, photo style)
3. Product Design (THE FOUNDATION - most important)
4. Logo Development (5 concepts → 1 selected)
5. Packaging Design
6. Product Photography Suite (8-12 images)
7. Brand Applications/Mockups
8. Brand Guidelines Document

**Quality Gates:**
- STOP if generating without references
- STOP if consistency breaks
- Always save strong outputs to reference library
- Build on what works, don't start over

This skill is central to building influencer brands for Wingman Project.

### Quality Patterns Identified:

**Strategic Depth:**
- Every project has conceptual narrative connecting brand to human emotions
- Names often contain hidden meanings or wordplay
- Research drives creative direction

**Typography:**
- Custom or heavily modified typefaces common
- Type becomes brand signature element

- Bold, intentional, distinctive palette choices
- Colors create instant recognition
- System applies consistently across all touchpoints

**Illustration & Characters:**
- Brand mascots add personality
- Hand-drawn elements feel human
- Characters become brand ambassadors

**Material Innovation:**
- Physical details matter: embossing, foil, special materials
- Tactile experience considered
- Craft elevated to premium

**Photography:**
- Lifestyle shots tell stories, not just show products
- Art direction creates cohesive visual world
- Products always in context

**Full-System Thinking:**
- Signage, packaging, digital, environmental all connected
- Nothing exists in isolation
- Brand extends to every touchpoint

**Tone:**
- Playful yet sophisticated
- Fun concepts with premium execution
- Never generic or corporate

### Application to Frontend Design:

When building web interfaces, apply these principles:
1. **Strategic narrative first** - what story does this interface tell?
2. **Custom details** - avoid generic components, add signature elements
3. **Bold color confidence** - commit to distinctive palettes
4. **Typography as personality** - font choices carry meaning
5. **Micro-interactions** - digital equivalent of tactile craft
6. **Cohesive system** - every element reinforces the whole
7. **Playful sophistication** - fun without being juvenile
