# E-Commerce Frontend Design Skill

## Philosophy

**Every store is a standalone piece of design.** Not a template with content swapped in. Not "what tile stores look like." A tile store in Miami selling to contractors is a completely different design problem than a tile store in Brooklyn selling to homeowners doing their first renovation. Same product category, different everything.

**Design serves commerce, but commerce looks different everywhere.** A streetwear drop needs manufactured scarcity. A luxury watch needs infinite patience. A supplement brand needs scientific credibility. A B2B supplier needs spec sheets and bulk pricing. The skill is understanding WHICH levers exist and having the judgment to know WHEN each one applies.

**Context is granular.** "Fashion" is not a context. "Scandinavian minimalist womenswear for professional women in their 30s who value quality over trends, price point $200-800, competing against COS and Arket" is a context. Every design decision flows from understanding at this level of specificity.

**The goal is that each store could only be for that specific business.** Someone should look at the site and think "of course this is how they'd do it." If you could swap in a competitor's logo and products without changing anything else, you've failed.

## Context Discovery

Before designing anything, develop a deep understanding of THIS specific business. Not the industry. This business.

### Business Identity

```
What does this company actually believe?

Not their mission statement. What do they actually care about?
- Are they obsessed with quality? Speed? Price? Service? Design?
- What would they never compromise on?
- What makes them angry about their industry?
- Why did they start this business?

What's their personality?
- How would they talk to a customer in person?
- What brands do they admire (even outside their industry)?
- What brands do they hate?
- Are they serious or playful? Formal or casual? Expert or accessible?

What's their position in the market?
- Are they the established leader or the hungry challenger?
- Are they premium or value? Mass or niche?
- Who do they compete with directly?
- What do they do that competitors don't?
```

### Customer Understanding

```
Who is the actual buyer?

Demographics are the start, not the answer:
- Age, income, location, profession
- But also: What do they already know? What are they afraid of?
- What are they really buying? (Often not the product itself)

What's their purchase journey?
- How did they find this product? (Search, social, referral, ad?)
- Where are they in the decision process? (Browsing, comparing, ready to buy?)
- What questions do they need answered?
- What objections do they have?
- Who else influences the decision?

What's the purchase feel like to them?
- Is this exciting or stressful?
- Is this a treat or a chore?
- Are they confident or uncertain?
- Do they want to linger or get it done?
```

### Product Reality

```
What is this product actually?

Complexity:
- Can someone understand it in 5 seconds, or does it need explanation?
- Are there variants, configurations, options?
- Does it require accessories or complementary products?
- Is installation/assembly/setup part of the product?

Tangibility:
- Can someone evaluate quality from photos?
- Does it need to be experienced? (Texture, fit, sound, taste)
- Are samples/trials possible or necessary?
- What can't be communicated online?

Stakes:
- How much does it cost?
- How permanent is the decision? (Paint color vs. tattoo)
- What happens if they choose wrong?
- How hard is it to return or exchange?
```

### Transaction Dynamics

```
How does money actually change hands?

Pricing structure:
- Simple (one price) or complex (variants, tiers, bulk)?
- One-time or recurring?
- Are there add-ons, services, warranties?
- How does this compare to alternatives?

Purchase frequency:
- One-time (mattress), occasional (furniture), regular (supplements)?
- Does this lead to other purchases?
- Is there a relationship after the sale?

Barriers:
- What stops someone from buying right now?
- Price? Uncertainty? Need to measure something? Need approval?
- What could reduce those barriers?
```

## Design Principles

These are thinking tools, not rules. Apply them through the lens of context.

### Principle 1: Hierarchy Is Meaning

Every page makes an argument about what matters. The visual hierarchy is that argument.

```
If the product is the hero:
→ Image dominates. Everything else is secondary.

If the deal is the hero:
→ Price and savings prominent. Value is the story.

If trust is the hero:
→ Proof leads. Reviews, credentials, guarantees visible first.

If the brand is the hero:
→ Aesthetic and experience dominate. Commerce is quiet.
```

**The question is not "where do things go" but "what matters most to THIS customer buying THIS product from THIS brand."**

### Principle 2: Friction Is Not Always Bad

Some friction is intentional.

```
REMOVE friction when:
- Customer is certain and ready to buy
- The purchase is routine or repeat
- Speed is part of the value proposition
- Friction serves no purpose

KEEP friction when:
- The purchase needs consideration (prevents returns, regret)
- Friction is part of the experience (luxury, exclusivity)
- Friction qualifies the buyer (B2B, professional)
- Friction creates anticipation (drops, limited editions)
```

### Principle 3: Trust Is Specific

"Trust badges" are not trust. Trust is answering the actual worries of the actual customer.

```
The contractor worries about:
→ Will this arrive on time? Will it match what I ordered? 
→ Can I get enough? What if I need more later?

The first-time homeowner worries about:
→ Am I choosing the right thing? Will I regret this?
→ Is this hard to install? What if I screw it up?

The luxury buyer worries about:
→ Is this authentic? Is this brand actually prestigious?
→ Will this make me feel the way I want to feel?

The business buyer worries about:
→ Can I justify this purchase? Will it perform?
→ What happens if there's a problem? Who's accountable?
```

**Don't add generic trust signals. Answer specific fears.**

### Principle 4: Information Architecture Serves Decision-Making

Not all information is equal. Organize by usefulness, not completeness.

```
ESSENTIAL: Needed to make the purchase decision
→ Always visible or one click away
→ Examples: price, availability, key specs, primary images

SUPPORTING: Helpful but not required
→ Accessible but not in the way
→ Examples: full specifications, detailed reviews, care instructions

REFERENCE: For specific situations
→ Available but buried
→ Examples: technical documentation, legal terms, detailed policies
```

**The density should match the buyer's needs, not your desire to be thorough.**

### Principle 5: Commerce Mechanics Are Tools, Not Checkboxes

Every commercial feature should have a reason for THIS context.

```
Upsells work when:
→ The additional item genuinely completes the purchase
→ The customer would need it anyway
→ The bundle creates real value (not just more revenue)

Upsells fail when:
→ They feel desperate or extractive
→ The customer hasn't committed to the primary purchase
→ The brand positioning doesn't support hard selling

Ask: "Does this help the customer or just the business?"
Sometimes the answer is "just the business," and that's a choice.
But know you're making it.
```

### Principle 6: Mobile Is A Different Problem

Mobile is not "desktop but smaller." Different context, different needs, different design.

```
Mobile users often:
- Have partial attention
- Are earlier in the journey (research, not buying)
- Need core information fast
- Will return on desktop to complete purchase
- Or will complete on mobile and need easy path

Mobile design questions:
- What's the ONE thing they need to see?
- Can they complete the action on mobile?
- What can wait for desktop?
- Where is the thumb? What's easy to tap?
```

## Commerce Pattern Library

These are tools that exist. Not a checklist. Use what serves the context.

### Product Presentation

**Gallery approaches:**

Single hero — When one image tells the story. Common for simple products, strong photography, brand-forward contexts.

Multi-angle — When the customer needs to see the product from different perspectives. Common for apparel, furniture, anything with physical dimensions.

Context shots — When seeing the product "in use" matters. Common for home goods, lifestyle products, anything where scale or application needs demonstration.

Detail views — When texture, material, or craftsmanship is a selling point. Common for quality-focused products, handmade goods, technical products.

**Video:**

Sometimes a video is worth a thousand images. Sometimes it's annoying autoplay that nobody asked for.

Use video when: demonstration matters, the product has movement/sound, installation/use needs to be shown.

Skip video when: photography suffices, the product is simple, you don't have good video.

### Price Presentation

**How price is displayed signals positioning.**

Price prominent, comparison visible — "We're a great deal. Look at the savings."

Price clear but not shouting — "Fair price for quality product."

Price understated — "If you have to ask, it's not for you. But here it is."

Price on request — "This is a conversation, not a transaction."

**Complex pricing needs clear structure:**

When there are variants, tiers, bulk discounts, or per-unit vs. per-package pricing, make the math obvious. Confusion kills conversions.

### Action Design

**Primary action should be unmistakable.**

But what IS the primary action?

Not always "Add to Cart."

Could be: Request a quote. Book a consultation. Get samples. Start a trial. Join the waitlist.

The primary action is whatever moves this customer to the next appropriate step for this product at this price point.

**Secondary actions matter too:**

Wishlist/save — For considered purchases when they're not ready today.

Share — When social validation or gift hints are relevant.

Notify — When out of stock or launching soon.

Compare — When evaluation against alternatives is part of the process.

### Calculators and Tools

**Only when they genuinely help.**

Coverage calculator — For products sold by area (tile, paint, flooring). Helps customer know what to order, reduces return rate.

Size guide/finder — For products where fit matters (apparel, furniture in space). Reduces "will this fit?" anxiety.

Compatibility checker — For products that must work with other things (parts, accessories, tech). Prevents wrong orders.

Recommendation quiz — When choice is overwhelming or personalization matters. Guides decision, captures data.

Build/configure tool — For products with many options. Makes complexity manageable.

**Every tool should:**
- Solve a real customer problem
- Integrate with the purchase flow (calculator result should connect to cart)
- Not be friction for customers who don't need it

### Upsells and Cross-sells

**Approaches:**

Complete the project — Things they'll need anyway (grout with tile, cases with phones). Genuine convenience.

Upgrade — Better version of what they're buying. Works when the value difference is clear.

Bundle — Pre-configured package. Works when the bundle is genuine value, not manufactured.

Subscribe — For replenishable products. Works when the economics favor customer and frequency makes sense.

Complete the look — For products with styling context. Works when the aesthetic connection is real.

**Warning signs of bad upselling:**

- You're suggesting things they obviously don't need
- The suggestions feel random or irrelevant
- The primary purchase isn't secured yet and you're already pushing more
- The brand positioning doesn't support aggressive commerce

**Some contexts demand no upselling at all.** Premium/luxury positioning often requires invisible commerce. The store should feel like a gallery, not a bazaar.

### Trust Architecture

**Types of trust:**

Social proof — Other people bought this and were happy. Reviews, ratings, user photos, "X people bought this."

Authority — Experts endorse this. Certifications, endorsements, media mentions, professional use.

Transparency — We have nothing to hide. Ingredients, sourcing, manufacturing, pricing breakdown.

Guarantee — We stand behind this. Return policy, warranty, satisfaction promise.

Track record — We've been doing this a long time. Years in business, customers served, projects completed.

Scarcity — This is valuable and limited. Low stock, limited edition, exclusive access.

**Deploy based on what THIS customer worries about:**

Professional buyers worry about reliability and support.
First-time buyers worry about making mistakes.
Premium buyers worry about authenticity and status.
Price-conscious buyers worry about value and getting scammed.

**Generic trust badges are often meaningless.** "Trusted by millions" without specifics. SSL padlock icons (everyone has SSL). Five identical review platform badges.

Specific proof beats generic signals.

### Information Presentation

**Tabs vs. scrolling vs. accordions vs. separate pages:**

Tabs — When there are distinct information types (specs, reviews, docs) and the buyer might only want one.

Long scroll — When the information builds a case and should be consumed in sequence.

Accordions — When sections are optional/secondary and keeping the page compact matters.

Separate pages — When information is dense enough to warrant its own context (detailed docs, legal).

**Specifications:**

Technical products need specs. The question is presentation:

- Table format for quick scanning
- Grouped by category for complex products
- Progressive disclosure (summary, then detail) for mixed audiences
- Downloadable PDF for professional contexts

### Email Capture

**Value exchange must be real:**

Discount for email — Works for price-sensitive contexts. Doesn't work for premium positioning.

Notify me — Useful for out-of-stock or pre-launch. Genuine utility.

Content subscription — Works when the brand has something worth saying. Doesn't work as a growth hack.

**Timing matters:**

Before they've seen the product — Annoying. They don't know if they care yet.

During browsing — Interruptive. Only if the value exchange is strong.

At exit — Desperate. Sometimes works, always feels bad.

Post-purchase — Appropriate. They've expressed interest.

**Some contexts should skip email capture entirely.** Premium positioning often suffers from aggressive list building.

---

## Composition Thinking

Don't follow layouts. Compose pages by answering questions.

### Above the Fold Questions

What must they see immediately?

For some products: The image. Nothing else matters until they see it.

For some products: The price. That's what determines if they keep reading.

For some products: The core value proposition. Why this, not alternatives?

For some products: Trust. They need to believe before they look.

**The answer changes by context, not by industry.**

### Information Hierarchy Questions

What do they need to know to buy?

List everything. Then rank it. Then design the hierarchy to match.

Essential → prominent, always visible.
Important → accessible, one click away.
Supporting → available, but buried.
Reference → findable if needed.

**Don't give everything equal weight. Decisions require hierarchy.**

### Action Flow Questions

What's the path from interest to purchase?

Simple: See it → want it → buy it.

Configured: See it → select options → buy it.

Calculated: See it → figure out how much → buy it.

Considered: See it → research → leave → return → buy it.

Staged: See it → request information → consultation → buy it.

**Design the infrastructure for the actual path, not an idealized one.**

### Trust Placement Questions

What do they need to believe, and when?

Early objections need early answers.

If they won't scroll without believing it's legitimate, trust signals go above the fold.

If they need to see the product first, trust comes after.

If trust is implicit in the brand, maybe it doesn't need to be stated at all.

### Commercial Pressure Questions

How hard should the page sell?

Depends on:
- Brand positioning (premium = soft, value = hard)
- Purchase psychology (impulse = push, considered = guide)
- Relationship intent (transactional = maximize, community = nurture)
- Competitive context (leader = confident, challenger = hungry)

**There's no right answer. There's the right answer for this context.**

## Quality Standards

### Brand Alignment

Does this feel like THIS brand?

- Could you put a competitor's products in this design without changing anything? (If yes, fail.)
- Does the visual language match the brand language?
- Does the commercial approach match the brand positioning?
- Would someone familiar with the brand recognize it without seeing the logo?

### Commerce Effectiveness

Does this actually work?

- Is the primary action unmistakable?
- Are barriers to purchase identified and addressed?
- Is trust architecture appropriate to customer concerns?
- Do upsells/tools actually help, or just exist?
- Can the purchase be completed on mobile?

### Information Architecture

Is information organized for decision-making?

- Essential information visible or immediately accessible?
- Supporting information available without overwhelming?
- Reference material findable when needed?
- Hierarchy clear? Nothing competing when it shouldn't be?

### Technical Quality

Does it perform?

- Fast loading (every second costs conversions)
- Mobile experience is designed, not adapted
- Accessibility basics covered (contrast, labels, keyboard nav)
- SEO fundamentals present

### Uniqueness

Is this design doing work?

- At least one thing that's surprising or unexpected
- Design decisions have reasons, not defaults
- Couldn't be mistaken for a template

## What This Skill Does Not Provide

### No Industry Templates

There is no "tile store template" or "fashion template." Two businesses in the same industry with different positioning, customers, and products need different designs.

### No Default Layouts

There is no "standard product page layout." The layout emerges from understanding what matters for this specific context.

### No Checkbox Features

There is no list of "features every store needs." Each feature is a decision based on whether it serves this context.

### No Assumed Components

Not every store needs: breadcrumbs, thumbnail grids, related products, email popups, trust badges, chat widgets, review sections, countdown timers, or sticky add-to-cart buttons.

Each component exists when there's a reason for it.

---

## The Standard

When evaluating a design, ask:

**"Could this store only be for this specific brand, selling this specific product, to this specific customer?"**

If yes, you've succeeded.

If you could swap in a competitor's brand and products without changing the design, you've built a template.

The goal is not a good e-commerce site. The goal is the only e-commerce site that could exist for this business.
