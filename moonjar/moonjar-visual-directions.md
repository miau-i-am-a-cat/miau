# Moonjar — Visual Directions

Three distinct interpretations of "Bottled Stillness"

---

## Direction A: "Lunar Minimalism"

### Concept
The moon as pure geometry. Stillness expressed through restraint and negative space. Japanese-influenced quietude meets Scandinavian precision. This is honey for people who own one perfect white bowl.

### Color Palette
| Role | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| Primary | Soft Silver | #C9C9C9 |
| Secondary | Ink Navy | #1A1F2E |
| Accent | Pale Gold | #D4C5A3 |
| Neutral Light | Warm Cream | #F5F2EB |
| Neutral Dark | Charcoal | #2D2D2D |

### Typography
- **Display:** Ultra-light extended sans-serif (think: Founders Grotesk Light Extended, or Neue Haas Unica)
- **Body:** Refined serif with high x-height (think: Tiempos Text, Freight Text)
- **Mood:** Whisper-quiet, airy letterspacing, lots of breathing room

### Photography Style
- **Camera:** 85mm f/2.8, centered compositions, mathematical precision
- **Lighting:** Soft single source, mimicking moonlight — cool but not cold
- **Styling:**极简 (extreme minimal) — one jar, one surface, one shadow
- **Surfaces:** Pale limestone, raw linen, matte ceramics
- **Color grade:** Desaturated, silver-shifted, low contrast, almost monochromatic

### Jar Design Direction
Tall cylinder, clear glass, minimal label — maybe just a small circular moon symbol. Let the honey speak. Matte silver lid.

### Overall Vibe
"The moon is a perfect circle. So is this jar."
A whisper. A haiku. A single held note.

## Direction B: "Night Garden"

### Concept
Nocturnal botanicals — the flowers that bloom after dark. Romantic but not precious. The warmth of candlelight in a midnight garden. More tactile, more human, more alive than Direction A.

### Color Palette
| Role | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| Primary | Midnight Plum | #2E1F3D |
| Secondary | Deep Teal | #1E3D3B |
| Accent | Aged Gold | #B8975C |
| Neutral Light | Parchment | #EDE6D8 |
| Neutral Dark | Soil Black | #1A1815 |

### Typography
- **Display:** Elegant serif with subtle contrast (think: Canela, Austin News Deck)
- **Body:** Warm humanist sans (think: Söhne, GT America)
- **Mood:** Warm, confident, slightly romantic — like a handwritten note

### Photography Style
- **Camera:** 50mm f/1.8, shallow depth of field, painterly softness
- **Lighting:** Warm tungsten + cool moonlight mixing, chiaroscuro shadows
- **Styling:** Abundance with restraint — dried flowers, linen napkins, candlelight
- **Surfaces:** Dark wood, aged brass, velvet, terracotta
- **Color grade:** Rich and warm, deep shadows, Baroque painting influence

### Jar Design Direction
Apothecary-style jar with cork or wax seal. Detailed illustrated label featuring night-blooming flowers (moonflower, evening primrose, night jasmine). Embossed or letterpress texture.

### Overall Vibe
"A midnight walk through the garden, honey on warm bread."
Sensory. Intimate. A little bit witchy.

## Direction C: "Observatory"

### Concept
The moon as scientific wonder. Astronomical precision meets archival elegance. For the person who has a vintage globe and reads Mary Oliver. Intellectual, curious, slightly eccentric.

### Color Palette
| Role | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| Primary | Archive Black | #0D0D0D |
| Secondary | Star Chart Blue | #2A3D52 |
| Accent | Celestial Gold | #C9A84C |
| Neutral Light | Aged Paper | #E8E2D4 |
| Neutral Dark | Iron Gray | #3D3D3D |

### Typography
- **Display:** Sharp transitional serif (think: Freight Display, Romana)
- **Body:** Classic book serif (think: Plantin, Bembo)
- **Accent:** Engraved or stencil capitals for labels
- **Mood:** Scholarly, precise, with personality — like a well-worn field guide

### Photography Style
- **Camera:** 100mm macro for detail, 35mm for context, technical precision
- **Lighting:** Dramatic spot lighting, stark shadows, museum vitrine aesthetic
- **Styling:** Specimen-like arrangements — honey as scientific sample
- **Surfaces:** Black velvet, brass instruments, vintage paper, glass vessels
- **Color grade:** High contrast, blacks are black, selective warm highlights

### Jar Design Direction
Straight-sided specimen jar with screw-top brass lid. Label features moon phase diagram or star chart coordinates for the apiary location. Batch numbered. Feels like something from a natural history museum.

### Overall Vibe
"Latitude 44.2°N. Longitude 72.5°W. Collected under waning gibbous."
Curious. Precise. A cabinet of wonders.
